# Technical Documentation


For writing style, tone, and voice guidance, use `Skill(ce:writer)` with **The Engineer** persona.

## Core Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure

Reveal information in layers:


**Warnings, breaking changes, and prerequisites go at the TOP.**

### 2. Task-Oriented Writing

```markdown
<!-- Bad: Feature-oriented -->
## AuthService Class
The AuthService class provides authentication methods...

<!-- Good: Task-oriented -->
## Authenticating Users
To authenticate a user, call login() with credentials:
```

### 3. Show, Don't Tell

Every concept needs a concrete example.

## Formatting Standards

- **Sentence case headings**: "Getting started" not "Getting Started"
- **Max 3 heading levels**: Deeper means split the doc
- **Always specify language** in code blocks
- **Relative paths** for internal links
- **Tables** for structured data with 3+ attributes

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Code examples tested and runnable
- [ ] No placeholder text or TODOs
- [ ] Matches actual code behavior
- [ ] Scannable without reading everything
- [ ] Reader knows what to do next

## Anti-Patterns


## Templates

For README, API endpoint, and file organization templates, see [references/templates.md](references/templates.md).
